		<p>A URL is another word for a web address.</p>
		<p>A URL can be composed of words (w3schools.com), or an Internet Protocol (IP) address (192.68.20.50).</p>
		<p>Most people enter the name when surfing, because names are easier to remember than numbers.</p>


		<h1>URL - Uniform Resource Locator</h1>
		<p>Web browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL.</p>
		<p>A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to address a document (or other data) on the web.
		<br/>A web address like https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp follows these syntax rules:</p>
		<h3>scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename</h3>
		<p>Explanation:</p>
		<p>scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)</p>
		<p>prefix - defines a domain prefix (default for http is www)</p>
		<p>domain - defines the Internet domain name (like w3schools.com)</p>
		<p>port - defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80)</p>
		<p>path - defines a path at the server (If omitted: the root directory of the site)</p>
		<p>filename - defines the name of a document or resource</p>
